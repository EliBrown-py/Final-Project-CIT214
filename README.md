For my final project I made use of almost everything I have learned in this class 
Less implementation: I use less implementation and defined variables to style my webpage. It was very helpful as I defined width, color code, height and applied it as I style my page it made my coding faster and shorter. 
Responsiveness: Responsiveness was achieved using bootstrap and flexbox it was very easy to combine I referred to flexbox because the controls you get over bootstrap is sometimes not sufficient and trying to use CSS can sometimes mess the whole thing up, I used flex box instead of bootstrap cards.
Hamburger Menu and favicon: To create the hamburger menu I used bootstrap, and it was very easy, and I use favicon as well to show an image that represents what I was working on the browser tab.
Features of bootstrap used include carousel, Modal, button, navbar one of the main reasons I use this bootstrap feature is because of it mobile first implementation by using bootstrap I was able to achieve a very good-looking webpage both on mobile and desktop. 
Accessibility: Accessibility is very important to me, so I took my time to name alt for every image used, I added label and role to each button to allow screen reader recognizes then.
